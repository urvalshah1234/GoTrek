      <p>
        GoTrek is a youth-run Non-Profit Organisation registered under the
        Bombay Public Trust Act 1950 with registration no. E/20483/Ahmedabad.
        GoTrek organizes adventure camping which aims to project young
        people into adventures and Himalayan exploration. Do not consider this
        as a leisure tour and GoTrek as a tour operator. Our idea is purely
        to serve adventure with a heritage touch.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{color:'orange'}} >Discipline</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Being an Adventure Camp and not a leisure tour, we expect a high level
          of discipline.
        </li>
        <li>
          All the participants have to follow the camp rules, timings, and code
          of conduct during the time of camping and travel.
        </li>
        <li>
          Punctuality must be taken as a serious matter. Participants will have
          to follow the instructions clearly given by the volunteer/guide.
        </li>
        <li>
          Misbehavior or arguing with the volunteers/guide/instructors will be
          considered a disciplinary issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of violation of disciplinary rules, GoTrek has all the
          rights to rusticate a participant or terminate the participation. In
          such cases of disciplinary violation or if participants wish to leave
          the camp willingly, the NGO will not be held responsible for any
          further services, return tickets, refunds, etc. Also, GoTrek is
          not responsible for your further actions, safety, or any other actions
          that can affect the locality and jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>
          GoTrek will not be responsible for any type of internal disputes
          or quarrels among participants.
        </li>
      </ul>

          be terminated, and no further services, return tickets, refunds, etc.,
          will be offered.
